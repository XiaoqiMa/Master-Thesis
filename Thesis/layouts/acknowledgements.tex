First, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor Florian Lemmerich for the continuous support of my master thesis and research, for his patience, motivation, and immense knowledge, also to my supervisor Prof. Markus Strohmaier for his insightful comments and encouragement, and last but not least to the second supervisor Prof. Bastian Leibe for his kindness and support. Their guidance helped me in all the time of research and writing of this thesis.
Second, I owe the success of my master study and this thesis to my parents, Xuyong Li and Xinlin Ma, and my girlfriend friend, Mingjiao Zheng. They supported me through the difficulties that I encountered during the work.
