### Structure

You need to know the common structure of a thesis proposal. The typical parts are as follows:

1. Abstract
2. Introduction
3. Existing literature/significant prior research
4. Thesis or project statement
5. Approach
6. Potential outcomes
7. Limitations
8. Contributions to knowledge
9. Proposed dissertation chapters



The proposal should discuss problem statement, objectives, research methodology, research activities, and a time schedule in about 3-5 pages



### Outline of the Master’s Project Proposal

The list below is a recommended guideline (except for time plan3) for your Master’s Project Proposal. 

**Title** 

Define a short, significant title which reflects clearly the contents of your report. The title page follows the guidelines of scientific proposals at Department of Earth Sciences (see http://www.erdw.ethz.ch/documents/index). 

**Abstract** 

Succint abstract of less than one page. 

**Table of content** 

The table of content lists all chapters (headings/subheadings) including page number. 

**Introduction** 

Explain why this work is important giving a general introduction to the subject, list the basic knowledge needed and outline the purpose of the report. 

**Background and results to date** 

List relevant work by others, or preliminary results you have achieved with a detailed and accurate explanation and interpretation. Include relevant photographs, figures or tables to illustrate the text. This section should frame the research questions that your subsequent research will address. 

**Goal** 

List the main research question(s) you want to answer. Explain whether your research will provide a definitive answer or simply contribute towards an answer. 

**Methodology** 

Explain the methods and techniques which will be used for your project depending on the subject: field work, laboratory work, modeling technique, interdisciplinary collaboration, data type, data acquisition, infrastructure, software, etc. 

**Time Plan for Master’s Project Proposal and Master’s Thesis** 

Give a detailed time plan. Show what work needs to be done and when it will be completed. Include other responsibilities or obligations. 

**Discussion / Conclusion** 

Explain what is striking/noteworthy about the results. Summarize the state of knowledge and understanding after the completion of your work. Discuss the results and interpretation in light of the validity and accuracy of the data, methods and theories as well as any connections to other people’s work. Explain where your research methodology could fail and what a negative result implies for your research question. 

**Acknowledgements** 

Thank the people who have helped to successfully complete your project, like project partners, tutors, etc. 

**Reference & Literature (Bibliography)** 

List papers and publication you have already cited in your proposal or which you have collected for further reading. The style of each reference follows that of international scientific journals. 

**Appendix** 

Add pictures, tables or other elements which are relevant, but that might distract from the main flow of the proposal.
