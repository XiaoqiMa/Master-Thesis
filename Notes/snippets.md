```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score

y = data.card
X = data.drop(['card'], axis=1)

# Since there was no preprocessing, we didn't need a pipeline here. Used anyway as best practice
modeling_pipeline = make_pipeline(RandomForestClassifier())
cv_scores = cross_val_score(modeling_pipeline, X, y, scoring='accuracy')
print("Cross-val accuracy: %f" %cv_scores.mean())
