The idea is to explore the effect of a specific variable in a classification or regression model through **Subgroup Discovery**. We would do this by creating variation/perturbation of some training or test data, i.e., we flip for example the value of the variable **under consideration** and the look at the outcome. Then we analyze these changes with subgroup discovery. 





**confusions**:

- how to choose datasets?
- explore effect of a variable or groups of variables?
- direct influence or indirect influence of the variable? 
- remove variable or change variable values? obscure the dataset?
- performance measure? balanced error rate? interestingness for subgroup discovery?
- subgroup discovery use libraries? 
- subgroup discovery --> search algorithms, pruning
