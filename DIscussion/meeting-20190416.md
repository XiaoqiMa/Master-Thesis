- datasets -- [UCI datasets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) 

- idea: first, we have some measurements, like importance score or average effect on the variable, e.g. 50% or 20% of importance. Then, we modify the variable(flip value, or remove variable), and find subgroups with stronger effect or reverse effect.
- first do some experiments on artificial datasets, using decision tree to see the effect. Then test on real datasets, e.g. text classification to see the effect of "gender"...
- extensions (further direction): on different models, like Markov chain model; effect on multiple variables; how to handle categorial variables; etc. 



- 6-8 pages proposal: introduction, related work, initial experiments, further experiments, further extensions, timeline/milestones

- After final submission: short summary for a Poster

- Code open source
